# Example1
- To build & debug the examples, run:
  - `npm link` at the root directory of this project 
  - then go to this example directory, then run:
  - `npm link @vanillajsx/vjsx`
  - after all, I suggest running:
  - `npm config set package-lock false` at the root directory
  - (in order to prevent unlinking)
- to start the dev server of this example page, 
  - run `npm run dev` at the root directory of this project.
